Tool instructions:
The tool can be accessed in the "Procedural_Kristian" scene in the unity project.
In order to use the tool, you need to start the game through this scene. 
While the game is running, you have two options:
- Spawn one tile of terrain
- Spawn multiple tiles of terrain.

If you want to save your generated level, you press the pause button and drag your generated level from the inspector to the asset folder.
This saves it as a prefab.
