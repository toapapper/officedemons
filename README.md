To play the game through Unity editor:
- Start the project (make sure the audio assets are loaded in. Instructions can be found in this Readme file)
- Navigate to the Scene-folder
- Double click on the MainMenu scene.
- Play and enjoy (we recommend that you play the Tutorial first)


The game is best played with a gamepad controller. 
If you do not have a controller the Keyboard & mouse controls are as follows:

Press once to select action, press again to lock it in. (only in combat)
To cancel action, press another button.
- Move/Aim = WASD or Arrow keys
- Attack = SHIFT
- Pick up/throw = Spacebar
- Special attack = CTRL
- Revive teammate = R


Tool instructions:
The tool can be accessed in the "Procedural_Kristian" scene in the unity project.
In order to use the tool, you need to start the game through this scene. 
While the game is running, you have two options:
- Spawn one tile of terrain
- Spawn multiple tiles of terrain.

If you want to save your generated level, you press the pause button and drag your generated level from the inspector to the asset folder.
This saves it as a prefab.


Audio Assets:
In order to add the audio assets to the Unity project you need to download the soundbanks and SFX folders from this link:
https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/11WOAF2qG6EOy1qGJwllM_sohewKJsGtS?usp=sharing

In that Google drive folder there is an instruction Readme file, that explains how the assets should be added to the project.

The soundbanks load in through the MainMenu scene. So it is only possible to hear the sound, if you load in through the MainMenu.
